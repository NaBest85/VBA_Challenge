# VBA_Challenge
Challenge 2
Nicholas Best
This challenge, code, was meant to loop through 3 worksheets to pull data of yearly change rate for each Stock Ticker along with their percentage of change and total stock value per year.  It was also to determine which Stock Ticker had the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.  This information, especially with a three-year data module would be incredibly useful to determine future stock fluctuations to improve decision making when buying, selling, or trading stocks to increase probability of a better return on the investments.
